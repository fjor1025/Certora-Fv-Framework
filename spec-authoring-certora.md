> **Purpose:** 
> This defines the **mandatory process** for authoring **execution-closed** Certora specifications.
> Any specification written without a **closed execution surface** is **invalid by construction**, regardless of property quality.

> **Core Principle:** 
> **Execution reality must be closed before properties are even named.**
> No invariant, rule, ghost, dispatcher, or assumption may be written before **all reachable EVM interactions are enumerated and owned**.

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE AXIOMS

> **AXIOM 1 — EXECUTION CLOSURE**
>
> *Every external call, external storage read, or external view function that can influence control-flow, state, or accounting MUST be explicitly modeled or explicitly trusted.*
>
> *Unmodeled interactions are adversarial by definition and invalidate the specification.*

> **AXIOM 2 — OWNERSHIP OF TRUTH**
>
> *Every value used in a property must have a single on-chain owner.*
>
> *If the owner is not the contract under verification, that owner must be modeled.*

> **AXIOM 3 — HAVOC IS A SIGNAL**
> 
> Any counterexample relying on HAVOC indicates missing execution modeling, not a protocol bug.
> 
---
## PHASE 0 — CONTRACT REALITY PRE-FLIGHT 

> **Goal:** Extract *execution reality* — not intent — from the contract.

🚨 **Hard Stop:**
If execution reality is incomplete → **Reject the spec**.

---

## 0.1 — VERIFICATION BOUNDARY IDENTIFICATION 

☐ Identify **primary contract(s)**
☐ List **in-scope contracts**
☐ List **out-of-scope contracts**

**RULE:**
Anything out-of-scope **must be modeled**.
Out-of-scope ≠ out-of-execution.

---

## 0.2 — ENTRY POINT ENUMERATION

> **View functions ARE entry points if they influence control-flow or accounting.**

Include:

* `view` pricing
* `view` permission checks
* `view` balance checks

If a view function is used in a `require`, it is **security-critical**.

---

## 0.3 — ENTRY POINT CLASSIFICATION 

### ☐ External Read Entry Point 

* Reads external storage
* Influences require/assert/branching

📌 **Rule:**
External reads are as dangerous as external writes.

---

## 0.4 — STATE MUTATION MAP (WRITE GRAPH) 

Add:

| Function | Writes | Reads | External Writes | External Reads |
| -------- | ------ | ----- | --------------- | -------------- |

🚨 **READ/WRITE PAIRING**

> Every external read must have a corresponding modeled write or be provably immutable.

---

## 0.5 — ASSET FLOW TRACE 

For each asset:

☐ Identify **owning contract**
☐ Identify **mutation functions**
☐ Identify **read-only checks**
☐ Identify **reentrancy window**

🚫 If asset owner ≠ this contract → must be modeled.

---

## 0.6 — TRUST BOUNDARY IDENTIFICATION 

**NEW DISTINCTION**

| Category            | Meaning                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Code-Enforced       | Solidity restricts behavior |
| Modeled-Adversarial | Modeled but hostile         |
| Threat-Model        | Assumed honest              |

🚨 Properties may **not** silently depend on Threat-Model actors.

---

## 0.7 — FLOW COLLISION ENUMERATION 

> If two flows can interleave on-chain, Certora must consider the worst ordering.

If not modeled → spec invalid.

---

# PHASE 0 HARD STOP RULE 

> No property discovery may begin until:
>
> * execution universe is closed
> * ownership of truth is assigned
> * modeling obligations are listed
---
## PHASE −1 — EXECUTION CLOSURE PRE-FLIGHT (MANDATORY)
> Each objective must list the **external truths it depends on**.

> **Hard Rule:**
> If Phase −1 is incomplete → **Abort spec authoring.**

### −1.1 — EXECUTION UNIVERSE ENUMERATION

List **all contracts that may participate in execution**, directly or indirectly:

* Direct call targets
* Delegatecall targets
* Callback targets
* Upgrade controllers
* Token contracts
* Oracles
* Registries
* Routers / hubs

📌 **Rule:**
If a contract appears in the call graph **even once**, it is part of the execution universe.

---

### −1.2 — INTERACTION OWNERSHIP TABLE 

For each external contract:

| Contract | Owns Which Truth? | Reads | Writes | Callbacks |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----- | ------ | --------- |

Examples:

* ERC20 → balances, allowances, supply
* Oracle → price
* PositionManager → ownership
* Registry → permissions

🚫 If ownership is unclear → spec must stop here.

---

### −1.3 — MODELING OBLIGATION 

For **each owned truth**:

| Truth     | Owner         | Modeling Required      |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| balances  | ERC20         | Dispatcher             |
| ownership | NFT / manager | Dispatcher             |
| price     | Oracle        | Adversarial or trusted |
| flags     | Registry      | Constant or dispatcher |

🚨 Leaving any row blank invalidates the spec.
---

## PHASE 2 — PROPERTY DISCOVERY/CATEGORIZATION (NO CVL YET)

> No property may reference:
>
> * balances
> * ownership
> * prices
> * flags
>   unless their owner is identified and modeled.

List candidate security properties **without choosing CVL syntax**.

> ❌ Do **not** write `invariant`, `rule`, `require`, or `assume` yet.

🚨 Develop a comprehensive list of properties in plain English, then categorize them using **`categorizing-properties.md`**

**NEW v1.3 Enhancements:**
- **Prioritization:** Assign HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority (Section 7)
- **Dual Mindset:** "Should Always" + "Should Never" enumeration (Section 5)
- **Test Mining:** Extract properties from existing tests (Section 6)
- **Best Practices:** See `best-practices-from-certora.md` Section 1 for property discovery techniques and common pitfalls
> These categories are NOT a commitment to invariant vs rule.
Right now, that rule is implicit, not explicit.
> Categorization at this stage is semantic only and **MUST NOT** be used to infer invariant vs rule.
> These categories describe what kind of harm occurs, not how the property will be encoded.

---
## HOW TO THINK ABOUT CATEGORIZATION (MENTAL MODEL)

| Phase        | Question Being Answered                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 0 / −1 | *What is real?*                                |
| Phase 2      | *What would be catastrophic if violated?*      |
| Step 2.5     | *How must it be enforced (invariant vs rule)?* |
| Phase 3      | *How do we encode it?*                         |

---

### A. STATE-INDUCTIVE SAFETY PROPERTIES

*Must hold in every reachable state*

* Solvency
* Supply caps
* Conservation laws
* Mutually exclusive modes

---

### B. STATE TRANSITION PROPERTIES

*Depend on specific calls*

* Access control
* Monotonicity
* Post-conditions of a function

---

### C. GLOBAL / CROSS-USER PROPERTIES

*Require aggregation or history*

* Global accounting
* Reward distribution correctness
* Cross-user conservation

➡️ Often requires **ghosts**

---

### D. ATTACK SURFACE INVERSION

*Adversarial reasoning*

* Theft
* Griefing
* Unexpected call sequences

> Phase 2 produces candidate laws, not enforceable properties.
> No item in this phase is guaranteed to survive Step 2.5.
---

## STEP 2.5: INVARIANT vs RULE DECISION GATE (MANDATORY)

For **each candidate property**, answer **in order**:

0️⃣ **Is all state referenced by this property owned or modeled?**

> ❌ No → **STOP** (model first)
> ✔ Yes → continue

1️⃣ **Is the question:**

> *“Can this EVER happen?”*
> ✔ Yes → **INVARIANT**
> ❌ No → continue

2️⃣ **Does it depend on a specific function call, caller, or sequence?**
> ✔ Yes → **RULE**
> ❌ No → continue

2️⃣.5 **Does it depend on external state not fully enforced by this contract**

(ERC20 balances, oracle prices, AMM reserves, lending protocol state)?

> ✔ Yes → **NOT an invariant**
> → **RULE or THREAT MODEL**
> ❌ No → continue

> 📌 Even if the external system is “standard”, “battle-tested”, or “widely used”.

3️⃣ **Would a single violation leave the protocol irrecoverably broken?**
> ✔ Yes → **INVARIANT**
> ❌ No → continue

4️⃣ **Does violation require a trusted role to misbehave?**
> ✔ Yes → **OUT OF SCOPE (Threat Model)**
> ❌ No → continue

5️⃣ **Are you tempted to write `require(property)`?**
> ✔ Yes → **Bug hiding detected**
> → Must be an `assert` or `invariant`
> ❌ No → classification stands

> 📌 **If unsure, default to RULE.**

---

# PHASE 3 — PROPERTY SPECIFICATION BLOCK

For each surviving property, output the following block:

**Name:** (e.g., `invariant_solvency`)
**Type:** Invariant | Rule
**Impact Category:** Theft / Insolvency / Privilege Escalation / Griefing
**Plain English Description:** The law being enforced
**External Truths Used:** (list contracts + fields)
**Revert/Failure Behavior:** (describe expected revert conditions, if any)

If non-empty → reviewer must check modeling.

> **NEW v1.6 — Revert Specification Requirement:**
> For each state-changing function referenced in a rule, document:
> 1. Under what conditions should it **succeed**?
> 2. Under what conditions should it **revert**?
> 3. Is the revert behavior verified via `@withrevert` + `lastReverted`?
>
> A property that only verifies the success path leaves the failure behavior undefined.
> If an attacker can manipulate *whether* a function reverts, that’s a security-critical
> behavior that MUST be specified.
>
> **Minimum standard:** Every rule for a state-changing function should either:
> - Use the complete Liveness/Effect/No-Side-Effect pattern (`@withrevert` + `<=>`), OR
> - Have a companion `_revert` rule that exhaustively enumerates revert conditions

---
## PHASE 3.5 — CAUSAL CLOSURE VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

> **This phase PROVES causal closure for each property before CVL is written.**

For each property in Phase 3:
1. Create entry in `causal_validation_[project].md`
2. Enumerate ALL mutation paths for involved variables
3. Write and run validation rules (templates below)
4. ONLY proceed if ALL validation passes

🚫 If validation fails → STOP and fix modeling.

---

### 3.5.1 — PROPERTY ANALYSIS TEMPLATE

For EACH property, document in `causal_validation_[project].md`:

```markdown
## Property: [PROPERTY_NAME]
**Type:** [INVARIANT/RULE]
**Source:** [Security property document reference]

### Variables Involved:
| Variable | Type | Location | Purpose in Property |
|----------|------|----------|---------------------|
| `variable1` | `uint256` | Storage | [Purpose] |
| `variable2` | `mathint` | Ghost | [Purpose] |

### Mutation Paths Analysis:
**`variable1`:**
| Function | Effect | Modeled? | Hook? |
|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| `function1(args)` | [effect] | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| `function2(args)` | [effect] | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ |
| `constructor()` | [initial] | ✅/❌ | init_state axiom |

### Causal Closure Status:
- [ ] All mutation paths enumerated
- [ ] All paths have hooks (if ghost involved)
- [ ] Constructor effects modeled
- [ ] Validation rules written
- [ ] Validation rules PASS
```

---

### 3.5.2 — CVL 2.0 VALIDATION RULE TEMPLATES

**Template 1: Mutation Path Completeness**

```cvl
/**
 * @title Mutation Path Analysis for [PROPERTY_NAME]
 * @notice Verifies all changes to [variable] go through expected functions
 * @dev If this fails with unexpected function, there's an unmodeled mutation path
 */
rule mutation_paths_[variable_name](method f) 
    filtered { 
        f -> f.contract == currentContract &&
             f.selector != sig:viewOnlyFunction().selector  // Exclude view functions
    } 
{
    // Capture state before
    uint256 valueBefore = relevantVariable;
    
    env e;
    calldataarg args;
    f(e, args);
    
    uint256 valueAfter = relevantVariable;
    
    // If value changed, it must be through an expected mutator
    assert valueBefore != valueAfter => (
        f.selector == sig:expectedMutator1(address,uint256).selector ||
        f.selector == sig:expectedMutator2(address).selector ||
        f.selector == sig:expectedMutator3().selector
    ), "Unmodeled mutation path detected for [variable]";
}
```

**Template 2: Ghost Synchronization**

```cvl
/**
 * @title Ghost Synchronization for [GHOST_NAME]
 * @notice Verifies ghost stays synchronized with storage after any function
 */
rule ghost_sync_[ghost_name](method f, address anyUser) 
    filtered { f -> f.contract == currentContract }
{
    // Require invariant holds before (proves inductive step)
    requireInvariant ghostMatchesStorage();
    
    env e;
    calldataarg args;
    f(e, args);
    
    // Verify ghost still matches storage
    assert to_mathint(storageVariable()) == ghostVariable,
        "Ghost [GHOST_NAME] desynchronized from storage";
}
```

**Template 3: Constructor Initialization**

```cvl
/**
 * @title Constructor Establishes [PROPERTY_NAME]
 * @notice Verifies property holds in initial state
 */
rule constructor_establishes_[property_name] {
    // Represent fresh deployment state
    require totalSupply() == 0;
    require ghostSum == 0;
    // Add other initial state requirements
    
    // Verify property holds initially
    assert [property_condition],
        "Property [NAME] not established by constructor";
}
```

**Template 4: Invariant Preservation with Dependencies**

```cvl
/**
 * @title Preservation Test for [INVARIANT_NAME]
 * @notice Explicitly tests that dependent invariants enable preservation
 */
rule preservation_test_[invariant_name](method f, address user) 
    filtered { f -> f.contract == currentContract }
{
    // Load dependent invariants (these must be proven first)
    requireInvariant dependentInvariant1();
    requireInvariant dependentInvariant2(user);
    
    // Assume this invariant holds before
    require [invariant_condition_before];
    
    env e;
    calldataarg args;
    f(e, args);
    
    // Assert it holds after
    assert [invariant_condition_after],
        "Invariant [NAME] not preserved";
}
```

---

### 3.5.3 — VALIDATION EXECUTION

1. **Create** `validation_[project].spec` with validation rules
2. **Run** Certora prover on validation rules
3. **Interpret results:**

| Result | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| All rules PASS | Causal closure verified | Proceed to Phase 4 |
| Mutation path rule fails | Unmodeled function mutates variable | Add to mutation path list, add hook if needed |
| Ghost sync rule fails | Missing Sstore hook | Add hook for the mutation path |
| Constructor rule fails | Initial state not modeled | Add init_state axiom or constructor model |
| Preservation rule fails | Missing dependency | Add requireInvariant for the dependency |

🚫 **Do NOT proceed until ALL validation rules pass.**
---

## REALITY CONSTRAINTS (ANTI-FALSE-POSITIVE FILTER)

Constraints **must not encode correctness**.

Allowed:

* Deployment facts
* EVM-enforced constraints
* Legitimate reverts
* Explicit threat-model trust

**Unrealistic Scenarios (Physics Only):**

Only exclude:

* EVM impossibilities
* Solidity type violations
* Explicit code-enforced execution laws

> If the blockchain could produce the state, Certora must consider it.

🚨 Any constraint whose removal reintroduces a **real exploit** is **invalid**.

---

**CVL Logic**

* Invariant → Global, inductive
* Rule → Pre / Action / Post
* ❌ Never `require` the property

**Ghosts Required:** Yes / No
**Attack Vector Caught:** Concrete exploit

---

# PHASE 4 — MODELING DECISION MATRIX

**HARD RULE**

> 🚫 It is forbidden to model correctness.
> Only execution behavior may be modeled.

For each external dependency:

### ERC20-like

✅ Dispatcher (default)
✅ Constant summaries only if immutable + pure read
🚫 Never `NONDET`

### Lending Protocols (Aave, Compound, etc.)

🚫 Never assume solvency or price correctness
🚫 Never assume interest monotonicity
✅ Model as adversarial external state

### ERC721 / ERC1155

✅ Dispatcher required
Model ownership changes

### IERC165

Never assume compliance

### Oracles / Bridges / Admin Registries

Model behavior, not honesty
Document trust explicitly

---

# PHASE 5 — GHOST ANALYSIS

**HARD RULE**

> If a ghost mirrors storage owned by a contract, the spec is invalid.

Ghosts may only represent:

* aggregates
* cross-contract totals
* history not stored on-chain

☐ Is all global truth derivable from storage?
If no → introduce ghosts

Rules:

* Ghost only reality
* Attach only to real mutation points
* Never ghost “correctness”

---

# PHASE 6 — FINAL SANITY GATE

Before CVL is written:

### Execution Closure Checks
☐ All entry points enumerated
☐ All state mutations mapped
☐ All external reads modeled or trusted
☐ Every external read has a modeled write
☐ All NONDET usages justified (see acceptable/forbidden rules)
☐ All contract-typed addresses bound or constrained

### Causal Closure Checks
☐ Causal validation completed for ALL properties
☐ **Function reachability: `satisfy` rules PASS for every state-changing function** ← NEW v1.8
☐ All mutation paths enumerated and validated
☐ All ghosts have Sstore hooks for every mutation path
☐ All ghosts have Sload hooks enforcing relationships
☐ Constructor effects modeled (init_state axioms)
☐ No causally unconstrained state changes
☐ No HAVOC-dependent paths to property variables

### Bounded State Checks
☐ Array lengths bounded realistically (< 1000)
☐ Timestamps bounded (<= max_uint40)
☐ Counter/ID values bounded realistically
☐ Loop iterations bounded in preserved blocks where needed

### Property Quality Checks
☐ No property mixes two truth owners
☐ No ghost competes with real storage
☐ No oracle / protocol assumptions hidden
☐ No invariant relies on documentation
☐ No exploit required away

### Edge Case Checks
☐ `Block.timestamp` dependence analyzed
☐ `Block.number` dependence analyzed
☐ `msg.value` influence on logic analyzed
☐ Silent rounding / truncation analyzed
☐ Zero-value edge cases analyzed

### Revert/Failure Coverage Checks (NEW in v1.6)
☐ Every state-changing function has `@withrevert` coverage (dedicated rule or Liveness pattern)
☐ Revert conditions documented in Phase 3 property blocks
☐ Liveness assertions use biconditional `<=>` (not just implication `=>`)
☐ `lastReverted` captured immediately after `@withrevert` calls (not overwritten)
☐ Non-payable function reverts included in revert condition enumeration
☐ Access control revert behavior verified (unauthorized → must revert)
☐ No rule silently relies on default revert pruning for critical behavior

🚨 If ANY check fails → **STOP** and fix before writing CVL

---

# PHASE 7 — CVL SPECIFICATION WRITING

> **Only enter this phase after Phase 6 sanity gate passes.**

**Use** `certora-spec-framework.md` **for:**
- Methods block structure
- Ghost and hook patterns
- validState() and validEnv() functions
- Invariant and rule templates
- CVL 2.0 syntax reference

**Workflow:**
1. Import Common.spec if using shared summaries
2. Write methods block (all summaries from Phase 4)
3. Write ghosts with init_state axioms (from Phase 5)
4. Write hooks for all mutation paths
5. Write validState() function bundling all invariants
6. Write validEnv() function for env constraints
7. Write invariants (Level 1 first, then dependent levels)
8. Write rules (call validState() at start of each)

---

## ✅ RESULT OF THIS CONTRACT

A valid spec must end with:

1. Complete execution-reality map
2. Explicit trust boundaries
3. Sound modeling choices
4. Correct invariant vs rule classification
5. Zero ambiguity about adversarial behavior
6. **Causal validation PASSED for all properties**
7. **All sanity gate checks PASSED**

---
